This is a request to replace the file `public/logo.png` with a new logo. Since the file is a binary image file, I cannot represent it as text. The update is to replace the existing logo with the new official Copetti's Barbershop logo. Therefore, the action to take is to replace the file `public/logo.png` with the new logo file.
